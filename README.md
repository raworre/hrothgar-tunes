# Hrothgar Tunes

This is the centralized repository where I will keep various music files that
are created on my journey through what [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net) has to
offer.

There is an overall art project that will be associated with this as the
project develops.

## YouTube

You can find recordings of these on my
[Hrothgar Warlock](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV81Zah5xOqX5npwF30WZBg)
YouTube channel.
